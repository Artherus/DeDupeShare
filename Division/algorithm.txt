1. Create a list of numbers which contains 
   check_list = [11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
   note: we have not included 1 as every number is divisible by 1 and
        2 through 10 are not included since 20 is multiple of 2,4,5 and similarly 18 is multiple of 3
        so, they are not included
2. define a function which does the division part of the code:
   a. perform loop which ranges from the passed value to some maximum value
   b. if the looped value is divisible by all number in check_list
      return the looped value
      else return none

3. assign the returned value from function to some varaible (soln)
4. if soln is none then print no answer
5. else print soln as required answer
